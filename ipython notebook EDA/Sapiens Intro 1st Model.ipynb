       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Cost of Thinking\\n\\n\\nDespite their many differences, all human species share several defining characteristics',\n",
       " ' Most notably, humans have extraordinarily large brains compared to other animals',\n",
       " ' Mammals weighing sixty kilograms have an average brain size of 200 cubic centimetres',\n",
       " ' The earliest men and women, 2',\n",

       " ' Neanderthal brains were even bigger',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThat evolution should select for larger brains may seem to us like, well, a no-brainer',\n",
       " ' We are so enamoured of our high intelligence that we assume that when it comes to cerebral power, more must be better',\n",
       " ' But if that were the case, the feline family would also have produced cats who could do calculus',\n",
       " ' Why is genus Homo the only one in the entire animal kingdom to have come up with such massive thinking machines?\\n\\nThe fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body',\n",
       " ' It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not easy to carry around, especially when encased inside a massive skull',\n",
       " ' It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even harder to fuel',\n",
       " ' In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2\\xe2\\x80\\x933 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body\\xe2\\x80\\x99s energy when the body is at rest',\n",
       " ' By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time energy',\n",
       " ' Archaic humans paid for their large brains in two ways',\n",
       " ' Firstly, they spent more time in search of food',\n",
       " ' Secondly, their muscles atrophied',\n",
       " ' Like a government diverting money from defence to education, humans diverted energy from biceps to neurons',\n",
       " ' It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hardly a foregone conclusion that this is a good strategy for survival on the savannah',\n",
       " ' A chimpanzee can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win an argument with a Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll',\n",
       " '\\n\\nToday our big brains pay off nicely, because we can produce cars and guns that enable us to move much faster than chimps, and shoot them from a safe distance instead of wrestling',\n",
       " ' But cars and guns are a recent phenomenon',\n",
       " ' For more than 2 million years, human neural networks kept growing and growing, but apart from some flint knives and pointed sticks, humans had precious little to show for it',\n",
       " ' What then drove forward the evolution of the massive human brain during those 2 million years? Frankly, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know',\n",
       " '\\n\\nAnother singular human trait is that we walk upright on two legs',\n",
       " ' Standing up, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easier to scan the savannah for game or enemies, and arms that are unnecessary for locomotion are freed for other purposes, like throwing stones or signalling',\n",
       " ' The more things these hands could do, the more successful their owners were, so evolutionary pressure brought about an increasing concentration of nerves and finely tuned muscles in the palms and fingers',\n",
       " ' As a result, humans can perform very intricate tasks with their hands',\n",
       " ' In particular, they can produce and use sophisticated tools',\n",
       " ' The first evidence for tool production dates from about 2',\n",
       " '5 million years ago, and the manufacture and use of tools are the criteria by which archaeologists recognise ancient humans',\n",
       " '\\n\\nYet walking upright has its downside',\n",
       " ' The skeleton of our primate ancestors developed for millions of years to support a creature that walked on all fours and had a relatively small head',\n",
       " ' Adjusting to an upright position was quite a challenge, especially when the scaffolding had to support an extra-large cranium',\n",
       " ' Humankind paid for its lofty vision and industrious hands with backaches and stiff necks',\n",
       " '\\n\\nWomen paid extra',\n",
       " ' An upright gait required narrower hips, constricting the birth canal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and this just when babies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heads were getting bigger and bigger',\n",
       " ' Death in childbirth became a major hazard for human females',\n",
       " ' Women who gave birth earlier, when the infants brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children',\n",
       " ' Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births',\n",
       " ' And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still under-developed',\n",
       " ' A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old',\n",
       " ' Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThis fact has contributed greatly both to humankind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extraordinary social abilities and to its unique social problems',\n",
       " ' Lone mothers could hardly forage enough food for their offspring and themselves with needy children in tow',\n",
       " ' Raising children required constant help from other family members and neighbours',\n",
       " ' It takes a tribe to raise a human',\n",
       " ' Evolution thus favoured those capable of forming strong social ties',\n",
       " ' In addition, since humans are born underdeveloped, they can be educated and socialised to a far greater extent than any other animal',\n",
       " ' Most mammals emerge from the womb like glazed earthenware emerging from a kiln \\xe2\\x80\\x93 any attempt at remoulding will scratch or break them',\n",
       " ' Humans emerge from the womb like molten glass from a furnace',\n",
       " ' They can be spun, stretched and shaped with a surprising degree of freedom',\n",
       " ' This is why today we can educate our children to become Christian or Buddhist, capitalist or socialist, warlike or peace-loving',\n",
       " '\\n\\n*\\n\\nWe assume that a large brain, the use of tools, superior learning abilities and complex social structures are huge advantages',\n",
       " ' It seems self-evident that these have made humankind the most powerful animal on earth',\n",
       " ' But humans enjoyed all of these advantages for a full 2 million years during which they remained weak and marginal creatures',\n",
       " ' Thus humans who lived a million years ago, despite their big brains and sharp stone tools, dwelt in constant fear of predators, rarely hunted large game, and subsisted mainly by gathering plants, scooping up insects, stalking small animals, and eating the carrion left behind by other more powerful carnivores',\n",
       " '\\n\\nOne of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in order to get to the marrow',\n",
       " ' Some researchers believe this was our original niche',\n",
       " ' Just as woodpeckers specialise in extracting insects from the trunks of trees, the first humans specialised in extracting marrow from bones',\n",
       " ' Why marrow? Well, suppose you observe a pride of lions take down and devour a giraffe',\n",
       " ' You wait patiently until they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re done',\n",
       " ' But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still not your turn because first the hyenas and jackals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dare interfere with them scavenge the leftovers',\n",
       " ' Only then would you and your band dare approach the carcass, look cautiously left and right \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and dig into the edible tissue that remained',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThis is a key to understanding our history and psychology',\n",
       " ' Genus Homo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position in the food chain was, until quite recently, solidly in the middle',\n",
       " ' For millions of years, humans hunted smaller creatures and gathered what they could, all the while being hunted by larger predators',\n",
       " ' It was only 400,000 years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular basis, and only in the last 100,000 years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the rise of Homo sapiens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that man jumped to the top of the food chain',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThat spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous consequences',\n",
       " ' Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years',\n",
       " ' This enabled the ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent lions and sharks from wreaking too much havoc',\n",
       " ' As lions became deadlier, so gazelles evolved to run faster, hyenas to cooperate better, and rhinoceroses to be more bad-tempered',\n",
       " ' In contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to adjust',\n",
       " ' Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust',\n",
       " ' Most top predators of the planet are majestic creatures',\n",
       " ' Millions of years of dominion have filled them with self-confidence',\n",
       " ' Sapiens by contrast is more like a banana republic dictator',\n",
       " ' Having so recently been one of the underdogs of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous',\n",
       " ' Many historical calamities, from deadly wars to ecological catastrophes, have resulted from this over-hasty jump',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Race of Cooks\\n\\n\\nA significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire',\n",
       " ' Some human species may have made occasional use of fire as early as 800,000 years ago',\n",
       " ' By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neanderthals and the forefathers of Homo sapiens were using fire on a daily basis',\n",
       " ' Humans now had a dependable source of light and warmth, and a deadly weapon against prowling lions',\n",
       " ' Not long afterwards, humans may even have started deliberately to torch their neighbourhoods',\n",
       " ' A carefully managed fire could turn impassable barren thickets into prime grasslands teeming with game',\n",
       " ' In addition, once the fire died down, Stone Age entrepreneurs could walk through the smoking remains and harvest charcoaled animals, nuts and tubers',\n",
       " '\\n\\nBut the best thing fire did was cook',\n",
       " ' Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural forms \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such as wheat, rice and potatoes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 became staples of our diet thanks to cooking',\n",
       " ' Fire not only changed food\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chemistry, it changed its biology as well',\n",
       " ' Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food',\n",
       " ' Humans also had a far easier time chewing and digesting old favourites such as fruits, nuts, insects and carrion if they were cooked',\n",
       " ' Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThe advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines',\n",
       " ' Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain',\n",
       " ' Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to have both',\n",
       " ' By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens',\n",
       " '1\\n\\nFire also opened the first significant gulf between man and the other animals',\n",
       " ' The power of almost all animals depends on their bodies: the strength of their muscles, the size of their teeth, the breadth of their wings',\n",
       " ' Though they may harness winds and currents, they are unable to control these natural forces, and are always constrained by their physical design',\n",
       " ' Eagles, for example, identify thermal columns rising from the ground, spread their giant wings and allow the hot air to lift them upwards',\n",
       " ' Yet eagles cannot control the location of the columns, and their maximum carrying capacity is strictly proportional to their wingspan',\n",
       " '\\n\\nWhen humans domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force',\n",
       " ' Unlike eagles, humans could choose when and where to ignite a flame, and they were able to exploit fire for any number of tasks',\n",
       " ' Most importantly, the power of fire was not limited by the form, structure or strength of the human body',\n",
       " ' A single woman with a flint or fire stick could burn down an entire forest in a matter of hours',\n",
       " ' The domestication of fire was a sign of things to come',\n",
